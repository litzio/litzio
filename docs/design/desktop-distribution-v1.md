Docling conversion uses the shared [Host worker runtime](plugin-runtime-v1.md).
Its dynamic commands/sidebar/tab view use [Plugin UI contributions](plugin-ui-v1.md)
through the same in-process origin and CSP (#857); no TCP listener is introduced.
The CLI distribution ships the self-contained worker beside its Editor assets;
Desktop copies that trusted bundle to the common user installation before first
conversion. It forks the installed copy with RunAsNode, retains in-process
`litzio://app` routing and stops local workers after the ordinary close gate.
The packaged CI smoke exercises this actual path with synthetic REST.

Brand defaults and packager overrides follow [the branding guide](../guides/branding.md) (#859). Product identity is separate from the fixed internal Host API; earlier verification records do not establish a migration from old Beta builds.

## Open folders in File Explorer (#487)

The Desktop preload exposes `openFolderInExplorer` as the Host capability, plus
`setOpenedFolders` to synchronize the renderer's currently opened root paths. Vite and HTTP
expose neither, so their folder menus omit the action. Root and child-folder More actions menus
use **Open in File Explorer** / **파일 탐색기에서 열기**. This adds no folder context menu.

Main's existing trusted top-frame IPC wrapper protects both calls. Successful shared Host root
listings register eligible local roots in main; synchronization accepts only those registered
roots and closing a section removes it from the active set. Main reuses pinned `RootAccess`
validation for lexical containment, real-path containment and root identity, and requires an
existing local directory before passing its canonical path to `shell.openPath`. Files (including
executables), absent paths, outside paths, UNC/device paths and escaping junctions are refused.
An OS error string or a rejected call produces a localized Editor error notice.

Automated checks inject the OS opener and never start Explorer. Manual Windows acceptance:
open both a root and a child via their menus; delete a displayed folder and confirm the failure
notice. Actual Explorer execution is deliberately unverified locally. Packaging/update/install
boundaries are unchanged; their tests remain Windows CI responsibilities.


## File context actions (#505 / #504 PR A)

Desktop uses the same web context menu and dialogs as Vite/HTTP; Electron `Menu.popup` is not
used. The preload bridge adds only the literal `fileDeletion: "trash"` capability. Paths and file
content continue through the shared Host transport, not a second IPC filesystem API. The custom
protocol routes `/api/file` to the existing shared handler and injects `shell.trashItem` as its delete
adapter after the same root/symlink/regular-file checks. An unavailable or failed trash adapter
returns an error and keeps the file; it never falls back to permanent deletion. Rename reuses the
same exclusive Host operation. Folder operations and reference rewriting remain out of scope.
See [filesystem operations](filesystem-host-boundary-v1.md#file-deletion-and-rename-505--504-pr-a)
and [session/focus behavior](editor-ux-shell-v1.md#file-context-menu-505--504-pr-a).

Local protocol tests cover injected trash success/failure and shared path validation. Packaged
Windows behavior remains a required CI check; no local package/install/update run is required
because packaging and update boundaries are unchanged.


## Optional command-line tools (#604)

Settings exposes **Command-line tools (CLI)** only when the Desktop bridge exists. The initial
state is Off; neither setup nor update adds anything to PATH. Enabled reports Installed, while
missing or mismatched owned files, application target or PATH registration report Broken path.
Broken registrations offer Repair and Turn off. A conflicting external `litzio` command or an
unowned file is reported without overwriting it. Operations report failures and allow another try.
The UI follows existing Settings sections, controls and tokens, in Korean and English.

The per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio\bin` directory contains a marked `litzio.cmd`, ownership
record and an owned `app` junction to the fixed installation folder. The ASCII shim uses relative
paths, disables delayed expansion, forwards `%*` directly, preserves standard streams and returns
the CLI exit code. It runs `app\Litzio.exe` with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` and the existing
`resources\cli\cli.mjs` bundle. It neither invokes a second command interpreter with `call` nor
changes the console code page. Core/CLI document semantics remain unchanged.

Like the [Paseo reference shim](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/blob/main/packages/desktop/bin/paseo.cmd),
it passes `--disable-warning=DEP0040`: the existing markdown-it dependency loads built-in punycode,
whose deprecation Node suppresses in npm's `node_modules` context but reports under `resources/cli`.
Other warnings and errors remain visible. Remove this targeted option when the shared bundle no
longer loads built-in punycode. This changes neither the dependency nor document parsing behavior.

The common CLI's standalone `--version` prints `litzio <CLI package version> (<commit>)`;
Desktop's bundle prints `litzio <Desktop package version> (desktop, <commit>)`. Both are one
stdout line with exit code 0. Combining it with any other argument fails through the existing
argument-error path. Build metadata is injected as literals, never read from files at runtime.
The commit is the actual checkout's `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD`; a build without Git uses
`unknown`. Unbuilt source/tsx execution explicitly reports `litzio development (unknown)`.

The existing CLI build and all its chunks/notices/assets are packaged outside ASAR as
`resources/cli`. Desktop and CLI `serve` both use its `editor/` production files: one build and one
copy, so their contents cannot drift. The standalone Node CLI/HTTP package is unchanged.

Only explicit enable/disable changes HKCU Environment PATH. The raw registry value and its
REG_SZ/REG_EXPAND_SZ kind are preserved, along with unrelated entries and ordering. Comparisons
expand environment variables and normalize Windows paths; edits do not rewrite unrelated text.
WM_SETTINGCHANGE notifies Explorer. The Settings hint tells users to open a new terminal.
Conflict checks include fresh user/machine PATH and the app's inherited PATH. No administrator
rights or machine PATH writes are used.
Fixed PowerShell code receives base64 UTF-8 JSON on stdin, never in argv. Long values, Unicode,
quotes and literal `%VAR%` expressions are preserved. The pre-write value/kind comparison detects
a stale snapshot; another process can still write between comparison and SetValue (not atomic).

Updates preserve the external integration and fixed installation target. NSIS actual uninstall
runs the same cleanup before removing application files; update's internal uninstall skips it.
Cleanup removes owned files/junctions and the integration's PATH entry, then removes the bin
directory with a nonrecursive `rmdir` if it is empty. A nonempty bin is preserved without error,
including user files and subdirectories. The parent `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio` stays: its creation
is not ownership-tracked and it also holds uninstall diagnostics. User data remains at
`%APPDATA%\litzio`, the updater cache at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio-updater`, and the default
installation at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\litzio`; none is part of CLI directory cleanup. An uninstall
from another installation cannot remove a registration owned by the current one. Damaged ownership
or conflicting files do not prevent removing our bin's PATH entries; unverifiable files stay and
Settings reports Off with the remaining conflict after successful PATH removal. Registry failures
remain errors. Optional cleanup failure never aborts app removal, including `/S`: NSIS writes a
unique diagnostic under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio\uninstall-logs` (TEMP fallback), with the bin path,
helper error and manual Environment Variables cleanup instructions. Interactive removal displays
a warning; silent removal logs it without waiting for input. This does not claim CLI cleanup
succeeded. Moving an installation leaves a broken target;
Repair from the new app rebinds it after the same ownership/conflict checks.

Verification scope: scratch files and an injected environment boundary test state, conflict, repair,
failure and raw PATH preservation without changing the developer's registry. Persistent-browser
bridge mocks exercise the actual Settings UI at 1440px and 640px. Disposable Windows CI checks
the packaged Electron Node engines range, Desktop version identity, shim help/check JSON and exit-code parity with Node,
argument/pipe forwarding, `serve`, real enable/disable, update preservation and uninstall cleanup.
CI also injects damaged ownership, foreign files, missing helpers and environment access failures
into interactive and silent actual removal, and checks long raw registry values round-trip.
Empty-bin removal and nonempty-bin preservation are checked for disable and uninstall. PR CI
and release verification run Stable then Beta install/update regressions on the same Windows
runner, retaining the precondition that no CLI bin directory exists before either run.
Manual acceptance still includes enabling in an installed app, running from a new terminal,
disabling, running after update and checking cleanup after removal. Local tests must not modify
the real user's PATH or registry; packaged Desktop/install tests run in CI for this work.
Long-running `serve`, actual console Ctrl+C and all `%`/`^`/`!` argument combinations remain manual.

Real Settings captures with a Desktop bridge mock: [1440px](../reviews/assets/desktop-cli-604/settings-1440.png)
and [640px](../reviews/assets/desktop-cli-604/settings-640.png). These show the Korean initial Off
state and existing Settings layout; the mock does not establish native registry/install behavior.

## Native sample

The bundled [converter control design notes](../../apps/editor/samples/en/converter-control.md)
ship as Korean and English folders, each containing a canonical native `.md`, `assets/` and
`references.bib`. The current UI language selects the sample when the user chooses **Open sample
document** on the start screen or in Command center, including when an argument document is open.
Changing UI language does not translate or replace an already open document.

On startup, Desktop offers samples only after safe preparation succeeds. A new copy carries
`.litzio-sample` ownership text and `version`. Replacement requires a real directory (no
junction/symlink in its ancestry or contents), the expected ownership marker and exact known
file/directory set. Added files, extra empty directories, changed entry types or unconfirmed
ownership cause a conflict: the existing folder is preserved and no sample paths are offered.

The original v1 copy is recognized only by its exact two regular files, `technical-document.md`
and `diagram.svg`, with no other entries. Their contents may have been edited; replacing those
recognized sample edits remains authorized. A missing version alone never proves ownership.
Unmarked copies of the unreleased bilingual layout are preserved as unconfirmed folders.

A differing bundled `samples/version` replaces a confirmed copy once. The same version preserves
edits. Copying finishes in a generated sibling directory, including version and ownership markers,
before rename installs it. A confirmed old copy is moved aside only after staging succeeds; a
failed installation rename restores it. Unknown or linked paths are never recursively removed.
Sample preparation errors are logged and carried to the Editor as a standing sample-unavailable
warning, while an argument document or empty startup remains usable. Both start screen and
Command center omit unavailable sample paths. Version `2` replaces the recognized original
sample; bump the bundled marker when sample contents change.
Runtime copies use explicit `copyFileSync` reads for the document, bibliography and image in each
language folder. Electron 44.7's ASAR wrapper extracts a file for `cpSync`, so it cannot copy the
bundled language directories as directories. The first PR CI hit an installed-start timeout on that
path; the correction keeps the existing archive-safe file-copy behavior. The unit test compares
all bundled files against the copied folder, so a new sidecar also requires updating the copy list.
The older unrelated `sample` directory is untouched. The development Editor uses the same copier
with a worktree-local `tmp/sample-native-v1` destination; HTTP Host offers no sample.

The samples use only [Native document support](document-support-v1.md). There is no new semantic
operation or CLI command: CLI `check` and `format` use the existing Core contract. The original
`apps/editor/document/technical-document.md` remains a regression fixture, not the distributed sample.
Core read-model feature coverage and canonical round-trip live in the existing Editor browser-fixture
tests. Desktop first-document unit tests use OS temporary folders outside the repository for legacy
recognition, foreign-file preservation, destination/ancestor/nested junctions, same-version edits,
copy failure and rename rollback; Host/client tests check that sample problems do not block startup.
Existing browser Command center checks
cover the UI entry and live language selection. See [sample capture evidence](editor-ux-shell-v1.md#localized-feature-samples-528).

For #528, packaged Desktop, install/update/uninstall, Edge and fresh-profile probes are intentionally
not run locally by owner decision. The packaged regression expectations are updated for CI.

## Start-up document path Unicode (#287)

`firstDocument()`는 시작 `.md` 인자의 단독 UTF-16 surrogate를 `assertUnicode()`로 파일 접근·경로 정규화 전에 거부한다. 원본 경로 없이 거부 사유만 `userData/logs/desktop.log`에 기록하고 해당 인자를 건너뛰며, 다른 유효한 문서 인자가 없으면 문서 없이 시작하고 기존 sample 사본을 제공한다. 정상 한글·emoji·리터럴 U+FFFD 파일명은 허용한다([경로 계약](filesystem-host-boundary-v1.md#path-unicode)).

## Scope and completion

The Desktop Host lives in `apps/desktop`. It ships the existing Editor production build and directly imports the existing document/asset Host handlers. `litzio://app` serves files and Host requests inside Electron; it starts neither Vite nor a TCP server. Core, File commit and CLI document operations do not change. There is no portable release, remote service, original-file autosave, cloud account or second editor state.

Completion requires the Windows installer, channel/state tests, packaged app and actual install/update regressions, the existing Core/CLI/Editor/browser checks, CI configuration and this documentation. Unsigned publication is restricted to exact `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` releases after these checks, with its signature status and possible Windows warnings disclosed. Authenticode credentials are prerequisites for signed releases and Stable publication. All publication requires owner authorization and actual master-only environment protection configured in GitHub; it does not require a second approval of the publish job. Real GitHub update delivery is distinct from the local feed checks.

The native window enforces a minimum width of **640px** (minimum height 480px), following [ADR-0010](../adr/0010-supported-viewport-and-input.md). Keyboard and pointer input are the supported interaction model. The packaged regression checks the native minimum size.

## App and Host

- App/product name: `Litzio`; App ID: `io.github.litzio.litzio`; updater cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio-updater`; preferences/sample/logs: `%APPDATA%\litzio`. These official defaults come from [brand.ts](../../brand.ts); #859 intentionally starts new identities without migrating previous Beta data.
- Windows EXE, NSIS installer/uninstaller, shortcuts and runtime window use the [Litzio wing/document icon](app-icon-v1.md). Its SVG source and generated ICO are tracked together; this does not replace previously published Beta assets.
- The per-user one-click NSIS installer requires no separate Node.js/pnpm/browser installation. Uninstall keeps user data. The Host supplies the first valid existing `.md` command-line file, or start information with writable samples copied into user data once per bundled sample version. Without an accepted argument it supplies no default document; the Editor may still restore tabs. Startup priority and session protection follow [Editing session and Save](editing-session-save-v1.md#tab-navigation-memory-383); if no tabs open, the Editor shows its [start](editor-ux-shell-v1.md#start-without-a-document-174). The sample opens only when chosen, through the same Open path as any file. Opening another argument into an already running instance and OS file association are not implemented.
- Electron main owns window lifecycle, protocol, preferences and updater. The sandboxed, isolated renderer has no Node integration; its typed preload exposes only update/settings calls and a restart check. Host/Markdown/file writes never pass through this bridge.
- IPC accepts only the app's main frame. External navigation/new windows are denied; http(s) links open in the system browser. Static paths are confined to the production build, including symlinks. CSP permits own scripts, own/inline styles needed by the editor/KaTeX, and local/data/blob images; no remote code or frames.

## Integrated Windows title bar (#605)

`BrowserWindow` uses `titleBarStyle: "hidden"` and a 39px `titleBarOverlay`, retaining native
minimize/maximize/close controls. Editor CSS reserves their actual Window Controls Overlay
geometry without a fixed button width; browser Hosts have no reservation. Header empty areas
use `app-region: drag`, interactive controls and shared portal popup/positioner/backdrop
boundaries `no-drag`. Menus preserve pointer input to other triggers; while
a menu is open, underlying shell headers temporarily use no-drag for outside dismissal. Full-screen Settings leaves only its 40px header draggable and retains
caption reservation at 640px. Native move/double-click maximize and
maximized inset behavior require Windows manual checks. Document tabs remain below TopBar.
The full-width title strip introduced by #647 and the Settings header keep their 40px total
height, including the 1px bottom separator. The native height is the content height:
`--layout-header-row` (2.5rem = 40px at the UI root size) minus `--border-width` (1px), not a
separate adjustable metric (#694). Changing either token requires updating the main-process
height; packaged CI compares it with the resolved CSS values. Native button widths, symbols,
commands and theme colors retain Electron behavior; the native painted/hit region ends one
pixel earlier, before the web border. CSS drag/no-drag and env-based width reservation stay
unchanged. Outline is below this strip after #647, including when docked.

Before #488 phase 0, Base UI could retain a 15px viewport gutter beside Settings. OS probes
showed that this area accepted solid canvas colors but clipped background images and fixed
DOM paint. #488 moved document scrolling below the header and keeps the body viewport locked;
Base UI respects that existing lock without reserving a root gutter. Both title strips now
span the full viewport. #694 adds no scroll-lock override, padding compensation or document
scroll change; its Windows pixel checks cover the integrated #488 behavior as well as the
native overlay correction. The earlier 13px sampled gutter interruption is historical evidence
in PR #696, not a remaining exception to the full-edge assertion.

The cause is established from Electron's [overlay height/color API](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/base-window#winsettitlebaroverlayoptions-windows-linux)
and its pinned [WinFrameView layout](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v44.7.0/shell/browser/ui/views/win_frame_view.cc)
and [opaque caption background](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v44.7.0/shell/browser/ui/views/win_caption_button_container.cc):
the old height 40 covers y=39, where the web separator is painted. A DOM border reaching the
right edge (#636) does not establish that the line survives native composition.
The renderer title is the active filename followed by ` — Litzio`, or `Litzio` without a
document, for native taskbar/Alt+Tab identification as well as browser tabs. The existing
beforeunload/unsaved-work protection remains authoritative for native Close.

Packaged CI checks actual Window Controls Overlay visibility/geometry at 1440px and 640px,
control exclusion from drag and BrowserWindow title. It also uses Win32 `ClientToScreen` and
`System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen` to sample the OS-composed separator below all three
caption buttons, in document/Settings, light/dark, 1440px with docked Outline open/closed,
640px, and maximized states, plus maximize/restore while Settings remains open. It checks
that Settings wheel input does not scroll the document behind it, and records the document
viewport/scroll and root/body geometry with every capture. A reference pixel outside the buttons checks screen-coordinate
alignment; a negative control restores the old 40px height on light Settings and must cover
the line before the fix is restored. Captures/measurements are uploaded as `desktop-caption-pixels`,
including failures. A missing foreground window, unavailable screen, or wrong reference color
fails the test rather than substituting renderer screenshots or skipping the assertion.
Both Settings and document captures must pass through the full caption edge, with no gutter
exclusion. JSON summaries record the root client gap and title-strip edge gap alongside all
pixel mismatches, so a future reserved gutter cannot silently become an allowed exception.
Local checks use persistent Chrome with
the bridge and representative caption-width geometry, including long filenames in Settings
and portal overlays over the wrapped header at 640×480; they do not launch packaged Desktop.
Manual checks still cover drag, native minimize/maximize/close hit targets (including hover
and press at the bottom edge), double-click maximize, non-default Windows display scaling,
rendered light/dark symbols and taskbar/Alt+Tab presentation. CI screen pixels do not establish
real-user Windows acceptance or all display-scale behavior.

## Log folder and process diagnostics (#712)

Settings → About & updates offers **Open log folder** / **로그 폴더 열기** only with
the Desktop bridge. It uses the existing small secondary Settings button, disables
while opening, and shows a localized failure notice with retry available. HTTP Host
and Vite have no such control. The no-argument `desktop:open-log-folder` IPC uses the
existing trusted main-frame check. Main creates `app.getPath("userData")/logs` recursively
if absent, then opens it through `shell.openPath`; renderer arguments never select a path.
Filesystem failures and nonempty OS error results reject the action. No Core/CLI changes.

The existing rotating `logs/desktop.log` writer records main `uncaughtException` and
default-mode `unhandledRejection` origins through Node's `uncaughtExceptionMonitor`.
It installs neither an `uncaughtException` nor an `unhandledRejection` handler, preventing
logging from swallowing a failure or changing Electron/Node's existing disposition.
The monitor also runs before existing exception handlers. This relies on the runtime's
default `throw` rejection mode; explicitly overriding it to `warn`/`none` is outside
this diagnostic guarantee. Only the origin is recorded, never the error/rejection
message, stack or value, which may contain document content or full paths.
See [Node's monitor contract](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#event-uncaughtexceptionmonitor).

`child-process-gone` records only type, reason and exitCode. `render-process-gone`
records reason and exitCode after normal startup as well as during the existing startup
failure path; startup dialogs and recovery behavior are unchanged. These are minimal
process-event records, not complete crash diagnosis. CrashReporter/minidumps, native
fatal signals and forced process termination are outside this change.

Verification: existing main-wiring tests cover trusted sender checks, fixed-path creation,
OS/filesystem failures, private-field exclusion and renderer exits after startup. A real
Node child-process check runs the registered monitor for both exception origins, proving
that default failures still reach stderr and exit with code 1. The existing `desktop-updates`
persistent-Chrome scenario covers bridge absence, no-argument calls, pending state and
failure/retry. Same-state English/Korean 1440×900 and 640×900 captures are retained locally
under `tmp/712/before` and `tmp/712/after`; these mock-bridge screenshots do not establish
Windows Explorer opening or native Desktop crash behavior. Packaged Windows checks run in CI.

## Appearance (#595)

Settings uses the same System / Light / Dark preference as the browser Editor, stored only
in the app profile's localStorage. The trusted main-frame bridge sets Electron
[`nativeTheme.themeSource`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/native-theme) and
returns `shouldUseDarkColors`; this controls native title bars and dialogs as well as the
renderer media query. Returning from an explicit theme to System resolves the native
answer before applying the final renderer theme. Live OS changes update System immediately.
The renderer passes resolved `canvas`, `surface-subtle` and `text` CSS roles to
`setWindowBackground`; main applies the canvas and titleBarOverlay background/symbol colors,
validates all three colors as strict `#rrggbb` and stores no theme or color preference.
The renderer uses a one-pixel browser canvas to interpret each opaque CSS role and read its
sRGB bytes as six-digit hex. This handles production minification (`#ffffff` → `#fff`)
without a second CSS color parser or changing tokens/design. Both bridge calls
use the existing sender check, and carry no document data.

Normally the hidden window appears once `ready-to-show` and the first themed background are
ready. Main starts a **15-second absolute startup deadline when the hidden window is created**,
before loading the renderer. It covers a missing first paint/`ready-to-show`, whether or not
appearance IPC arrives. First paint also starts the existing five-second appearance wait:
a local CSS/IPC cosmetic handshake requires no network. The earlier deadline wins; first paint
never restarts or extends the absolute deadline. Fifteen seconds allows ten seconds for initial
loading/first paint plus the existing five-second cosmetic allowance. These are bounded failure
allowances, not startup performance targets (the existing restart handshake also allows five
seconds). Normal readiness still reveals immediately without waiting for either deadline.
Timeout or a trusted appearance-handler failure
reveals the window and logs the cause. Main-frame `did-fail-load`, rejected `loadURL` or renderer
exit during hidden startup also reveal it and show an error dialog, even before `ready-to-show`.
The startup gate is consumed once and both timers are cancelled on normal readiness, fallback,
second-instance reveal or close. Late first paint/appearance signals and subsequent appearance changes
do not reveal a window the user hid. A second launch shows a hidden existing window, restores
it if minimized and focuses it. Initialization exceptions after `whenReady` are logged, shown
in an error dialog and terminate with exit code 1 rather than leave a windowless process.

The small external `theme-init.js` sets the renderer's initial theme and native
color scheme before the application bundle, without weakening the self-only script CSP.
Styles then own `color-scheme`. No window-background color literal is duplicated in main.
The packaged argument/Save/restart regression also checks explicit/System native source,
effective renderer/native agreement, background and profile restoration. This packaged
verification runs in CI; local checks use Desktop unit/type checks and the browser bridge
regression. Native OS theme-change automation is not claimed.

Main writes `starting <version>` to `userData/logs/desktop.log` before initialization and
retains the detailed `started` entry before window creation. A secondary process that loses
the single-instance lock exits before these entries. Failures before main/ready handling can
also precede file logging. Directory creation, rotation or append failure can prevent a log
file; these errors now go to stderr with the intended message instead of being silently
discarded. The #643 problem PC's missing folder was not attributable to a specific one of
these paths from available evidence; an appearance rejection itself happens after startup
logging. No alternate userData location or speculative filesystem repair is introduced.

## Channels and versions

The public distribution is `0.0.2-beta.4`; Stable publication is deferred. See the [#758 release record](../releases/v0.0.2-beta.4.md) for the successful first release-workflow attempt, public assets and Korean Release body. Actual GitHub `0.0.2-beta.3 → 0.0.2-beta.4` installation/update is **not run and unverified** because this PC’s installed state must remain unchanged. Local-feed CI is separate evidence.

The preceding public distribution was `0.0.2-beta.3`. See the [#690 release record](../releases/v0.0.2-beta.3.md) for the successful first release-workflow attempt, public assets and Korean Release body. Actual GitHub `0.0.2-beta.2 → 0.0.2-beta.3` installation/update is **not run and unverified** because this PC’s installed state must remain unchanged. Local-feed CI is separate evidence.

An earlier public distribution was `0.0.2-beta.2`. See the [#659 release record](../releases/v0.0.2-beta.2.md) for the successful first release-workflow attempt, public assets and CI results. Actual GitHub `0.0.2-beta.1 → 0.0.2-beta.2` installation/update was not run by owner decision and remains unverified.

For the preceding #632 correction, the owner confirmed there were no existing users and approved correcting only the version. After verifying the new public assets, the two `0.1.0` Beta Releases/assets/remote tags were withdrawn; source commits and historical verification records remain. Downgrade protection and migration policy remain unchanged: an installed `0.1.0-beta.*` cannot automatically update down to `0.0.2-beta.1` and requires manual replacement. See the [#632 release record](../releases/v0.0.2-beta.1.md) for publication, withdrawal and the unverified actual GitHub installation/update boundary.

On first launch, an installed `X.Y.Z-beta.N` defaults to Beta and a Stable version defaults to Stable. A valid saved Stable/Beta choice always wins, including after installing a different version. Missing/damaged preferences or an invalid/missing channel fall back to the installed version's default. Preferences are persisted by temporary sibling/rename. Settings → About & updates shows installed version, channel, update status/actions and a Release notes link.

The withdrawn [0.1.0-beta.2 release record](../releases/v0.1.0-beta.2.md) preserves its publication, public asset hashes, CI and unverified actual GitHub beta.1→beta.2 delivery. The withdrawn [0.1.0-beta.1 release record](../releases/v0.1.0-beta.1.md) preserves its earlier actual GitHub 0.0.1-beta.4→0.1.0-beta.1 update evidence. These historical results do not verify the current release; earlier verification below also remains historical.

| Channel | Feed and offer | Release assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | GitHub's latest full release; only a greater stable semver is offered | `latest.yml` |
| Beta | Newest Beta or Stable; only a greater semver is offered | Beta publishes `beta.yml`; a Stable release's `latest.yml` is the provider fallback |

Tags are exactly `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`; tag, app/package version and update metadata must agree. Beta Releases have `prerelease=true`; Stable Releases have `prerelease=false`. Other prerelease channels are rejected. Setting the updater channel is followed by explicit `allowPrerelease` and `allowDowngrade=false`, because the library's channel setter enables downgrades. A Beta → Stable switch keeps an installed newer Beta until a newer Stable exists.

Before the first public release, local development versions can be reset. A previously installed `0.1.0` development build cannot update down to `0.0.1-beta.1`; replace that development installation manually without weakening downgrade protection. Beta publication may use the restricted unsigned mode; Stable publication requires signing. Both require matching tag/version/channel, verified assets and passing CI.

`generateUpdatesFilesForAllChannels=false` and explicit publish channels prevent a Beta from generating Stable metadata. Artifact validation refuses the other channel file. Channel changes during download/install are refused; late check results from a previous channel are ignored. A downloaded update stays ready until installation or a channel change makes it ineligible.

## Window close

Electron retains its native **Close without saving / Keep editing** dialog. All-tab protection,
the distinction from single-tab Close and recovery retention follow the
[session protection contract](editing-session-save-v1.md#switching-and-recovery).

Client recovery uses IndexedDB at the stable `litzio://app` origin in Electron's persistent
default session, under the app profile. The packaged regression checks identical `userData` and
`sessionData` paths across new app PIDs, actual forced termination and normal window close, and
record/Restore/Save/Reload/conflict preservation. It keeps its test profile and resets recovery
only at the beginning of each test, never between that test's restarts. The close-dialog response
is stubbed through the existing harness; native window lifecycle, protocol, storage and files are
real. See [Host recovery boundaries](editing-session-save-v1.md#host-persistence-verification-296-pr3)
for the last-successful-record and platform limits.

## Update lifecycle and work protection

- Check 15 seconds after launch, then every 6 hours; retry a failed check after 30 minutes. Manual Check for updates is immediate. Only one check is in flight; errors never block editing.
- Finding an update downloads nothing (`autoDownload=false`). Download update starts the real updater download and progress events. A verified download does not restart or install on ordinary quit (`autoInstallOnAppQuit=false`). Update discovery uses the Settings dot described below; About remains available.
- New-version discovery (#665): remove the top View / Later notification and its postponed-version preference. An unseen offered version displays one 8px interaction-accent dot on the bottom Settings icon, both in the expanded Sidebar and collapsed rail. The localized native tooltip names the version (`New version <version> available` / `새 버전 <version> 사용 가능`), and the button's accessible name adds new-version availability so color is not the only cue.
- Clicking Settings with the dot opens About & updates directly and highlights the update actions. Opening About by any route records the offered version as `seenUpdate` in Desktop preferences, including a new offer arriving while About is open. That version stays acknowledged after reload/restart; a newer offered version shows the dot again. A successful update no longer offers the installed version. There is no migration of the former Later setting. Without a dot, Settings continues to open Appearance & language. Download, installation consent and restart guards remain unchanged.
- Restart to update disables window input and asks the live Editor whether all tabs are safe, using the [session work-protection contract](editing-session-save-v1.md#save-shortcut-and-work-loss-protection-56). No user-input dialog is added inside the timed handshake.
- Missing/malformed answers, renderer failure or a 5-second timeout refuse and re-enable the window. The existing `beforeunload` remains a second check. `quitAndInstall(true, true)` runs only after the agreed window close; a close veto returns to the downloaded state. Updates never discard or save user work implicitly.

The [client recovery contract](editing-session-save-v1.md#local-recovery-records-296-pr2) owns recording/deletion. Windows Desktop crash/profile persistence checks and remaining limits are recorded in [Host persistence verification](editing-session-save-v1.md#host-persistence-verification-296-pr3).

## Verification and signing

The direct-start packaged check identifies its root through the live launched ChildProcess and executable, then follows parent PID edges with consistent creation times. If a first-observed process's recorded parent PID now names a younger owned process, processes older than the root are excluded; processes created at or after the root are owned only with an executable under the launched app's directory, otherwise measurement fails with an ambiguous-ownership diagnostic. Confirmed live child identities (PID plus creation time) persist across the initial and final samples and each sample's enumerations, even if their parent exits or its PID is reused. Collection is asynchronous so the original process handle's exit remains observable. Root and sampled listener identities are confirmed after TCP enumeration; missing/reused identities fail measurement. Both samples assert no TCP listeners. The process/TCP/process sequence is not atomic, cannot reconstruct all unobserved ancestry, and does not assert updater/installer leftovers after exit. CI can encounter ambiguous ownership if an external/unknown image meets these conditions; it must fail rather than omit that process. See [Windows Desktop regression](../test/README.md#windows-desktop-regression) for the #491 ownership regression and diagnostic fields.

The updater uses its own SHA-512 download verification. A signed release build additionally uses the public `NsisUpdater.verifyUpdateCodeSignature` hook for strict Windows Authenticode verification: status must be Valid and the publisher must match `app-update.yml`; missing tools/errors refuse the update. It repeats that check before marking the download installable, including cache reuse (6.x skips the fresh-download signature hook for a cached file). Unsigned Betas do not enable this publisher-signature check. Code-signing secrets are supplied only by the release environment, never source/logs.

electron-updater 6.8.9 does not use a detached signature for `latest.yml`/`beta.yml`. The unsigned Beta relies on GitHub HTTPS/release access control and version/channel/hash validation; a checksum alone does not authenticate a publisher. Signed releases additionally validate the installer publisher signature. Local test feeds do not establish real GitHub delivery or SmartScreen reputation.

## Build and release procedure

Development and package/test commands, the CI jobs, signing setup and the publication boundary are documented in [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Verification](../test/README.md). Packaging removes its generated output first so test feeds, versions and old channel files cannot survive into a normal build. No build command publishes.

PR/merge-group/push CI builds and tests unsigned packages and cannot publish. It does not upload development installers. Package creation, release-asset verification, packaged regressions and policy-selected install/update/uninstall checks remain required. Failure artifacts retain only packaged `profiles/*/logs/desktop.log*`, `recovery-proof.json`, update test `v*/latest.yml` and `v*/beta.yml`, uninstall `*-dialogs.txt`/`*-cleanup.txt` and durable `%LOCALAPPDATA%\litzio\uninstall-logs\*.tmp` diagnostics for 7 days. The latter use a separate `desktop-uninstall-logs` artifact with a path selected from `brand.ts`, because Windows runner user logs and the checkout can be on different drives. Execution logs and direct-start measurements remain in Actions logs. Diagnostic uploads exclude executables, blockmaps and whole installation, browser-profile or cache trees. Small native caption evidence remains available on success or failure for 7 days.

The manual workflow runs only from master and defaults to `verify`. Its `desktop-release` artifact retains the installer, blockmap, channel manifests and `win-unpacked/` for 14 days because publication downloads and revalidates them. Release assets, global retention, queue concurrency and CI execution/success policy are unchanged by the ordinary-CI upload policy. `unsigned-beta` publishes only exact Beta tags; `signed` retains mandatory credentials, forceCodeSigning and strict publisher verification for Stable or Beta.

Every release mode reruns the full Editor browser regressions on the validated tag commit in four Linux shards (`pnpm browser:test --shard=N/4`), without reusing PR/push CI results. The browser job matches CI's Playwright container, pinned Chromium installation, browser cache and Korean font check, with a 35-minute timeout per shard. `fail-fast: false` lets the remaining shards finish; failed shards retain Vite server logs and browser diagnostics in separate artifacts. The Windows job runs the workspace tests, actual Electron packaged regressions and both Stable/Beta NSIS install/update tests before producing a clean package. Every mode also runs the alternate-brand proof on the validated tag commit in a separate Windows job. That job builds its own unsigned official package before running the unchanged proof; it cannot overwrite the publication build or access signing secrets. Publication uses `needs: [preflight, browser, build, brand]` and the default success condition: all browser shards, the Windows build and brand proof must succeed; a failure or cancellation prevents publication. This avoids the observed Windows Vite browser-runner `ERR_NO_BUFFER_SPACE` failure without omitting browser scenarios or accepting network errors.

Preflight executes the controller from the dispatch master SHA before installing dependencies or running tag code. It validates the mode and canonical tag, requires an existing local/remote tag and matching Desktop package version, proves the peeled tag commit is an ancestor of that trusted SHA, then builds that immutable commit. Publication reruns preflight from the trusted controller and checks the remote tag immediately before activation. Tag, package, installer/app PE FileVersion and metadata agree. The pinned builder recomputes the installer blockmap; metadata names one installer with its exact size/SHA-512. Other-channel metadata and test-host configurations are refused.

Only the publication job has `contents: write`; it uses `desktop-release`. On 2026-10-28 the owner requested removing the separate manual publish approval. The required reviewer was removed through the GitHub API; read-back confirmed no reviewer or wait timer and exactly one custom deployment branch policy allowing branch `master`. Owner authorization and manual dispatch from master remain required; successful preflight, browser and build jobs lead directly to publication. This setting change does not alter PR review, app download/install consent or signed-release requirements. Maintainers must recheck the actual environment rules before subsequent publication. Signed mode additionally needs signing secrets, which remain unconfigured.

Historically, the environment required reviewer `SWBaek` with self-review and administrator bypass allowed from 2026-10-12. The 0.1.0-beta.2 publication used the owner's explicit request for agent approval before that reviewer rule was removed. The [release record](../releases/v0.1.0-beta.2.md) preserves that sequence.

The authenticated, paginated release list includes Drafts; any existing same-tag Release is refused. A new Draft is created with the correct prerelease/latest policy, and its returned ID is used for uploads and reads. Only installer, blockmap and the correct channel manifest are uploaded. The exact asset set, uploaded state, size and server SHA-256 must match before the final activation request. Beta always has `prerelease=true` and `latest=false`, with `beta.yml` only. Assets are never clobbered. Pre-activation failures leave a Draft for operator review. A lost response to the final activation request cannot establish whether GitHub applied it; the script reports the Release ID and requires confirmation, without automatic retry/delete.

The first beta.1 was published by the earlier CI-artifact procedure. Subsequent releases use this workflow. See [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#windows-desktop-builds-and-releases) for the approval/tag/verification/publication sequence and [beta.2 notes](../releases/v0.0.1-beta.2.md) for publication and verification evidence.

## Stable not yet published

`IeumGitHubProvider` is a small adapter over pinned electron-updater 6.8.9's GitHubProvider. The provider wraps the structured HTTP error from latest-full lookup twice and loses its status; matching every 404 or parsing the wrapped error text is unsafe. The adapter observes the existing requests, without extra API polling. A valid empty Atom feed, or a valid Beta-only repository feed together with 404 at the exact latest-full endpoint, establishes absence. Public github.com returned 406 for this JSON endpoint when only beta.1 was public (confirmed during preparation on 2026-10-12); that status is accepted only at github.com with the same Beta-only evidence. Feed/asset 404s, a latest failure with Stable in the feed, malformed feeds, missing/corrupt metadata and other network failures remain errors.

GitHub's Atom feed also lists non-release tags: the feed inspected during preparation included `archive/*` spikes in addition to public beta.1. Like the library's Beta selector, the adapter ignores non-semver tags, but requires at least one canonical Beta version and no Stable version for the latest-endpoint absence classification. Malformed links, another repository or unrecognized version channels remain errors.

Stable absence yields `no-stable-release`, displayed as **No Stable release has been published yet.** It uses the normal 6-hour interval, keeps the Editor/Settings usable, and permits Beta selection/manual checks. The adapter resets evidence on each check so the first Stable publication resumes normal selection. The existing generation guard discards late results after channel changes. The library still owns selection, metadata parsing, checksum/download and signature handling; downgrade policy is unchanged.

## Evidence and limits

Beta.2 candidate verification on 2026-10-12: frozen install, full typecheck/docs, workspace tests (520 passed and 2 existing Windows skips), final Desktop integration (37), final full browser regression (43), clean Windows Beta package with PE versions/SHA-512/size/recomputed blockmap, packaged regressions (8), real NSIS local-feed Stable and Beta updates, actionlint and 21 Windows PowerShell run-step parses passed. The packaged live Stable lookup showed the expected absence message with the actual archive-tag feed. Installer remains unsigned. An initial browser run missed one expected save-session HTTP400 console entry; unchanged isolated and full rechecks passed without weakening criteria. The expanded install test initially needed its canary parent folder created, which was fixed; both final install/update runs passed and uninstalled their own app.

See the [beta.2 release record](../releases/v0.0.1-beta.2.md) for exact scope, failure defenses and public artifact fingerprints. The approved manual workflow published beta.2 after successful Linux browser and Windows NSIS/package checks. Anonymous downloads and the actual public beta.1→beta.2 installation passed, including ordinary-quit protection, unsaved-work refusal and saved Markdown/preferences/channel/user-data preservation. The following initial implementation/preparation measurements are historical evidence and remain unchanged.

Initial Desktop implementation verification on 2026-10-12:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Frozen install, full workspace typecheck, docs checker tests/check and diff whitespace | Passed; docs checker tests 5 |
| Core / File commit / CLI / Editor / Desktop unit/integration | 210 / 2 / 46 / 225 / 30 passed; File commit has 2 existing Windows-only environment skips |
| Full browser suite | 43 passed after the unload fix; source fixture preservation and runner cleanup included |
| Actual NSIS install/update with a local stand-in feed | Passed: ordinary quit does not install; missing IPC answer/renderer check error/dirty document refuse; Save then update 0.0.1→0.0.2, relaunch, document preservation and uninstall |
| Normal 0.1.0 package and packaged regressions | Artifact verification and all 7 regressions passed; no forced process termination needed |
| Initial Beta test package | 0.1.0-beta.1 built/verified with `beta.yml`, no `latest.yml`; at that stage the normal package was reset to 0.1.0 and github.com |
| Public build without credentials | Refused by `forceCodeSigning`; this is an expected negative check |
| Workflows | actionlint 1.7.12 and PowerShell parsing of all 21 Windows run steps passed; GitHub jobs/publication not executed |

The initial 0.1.0 Windows app showed its window in 732 ms: 4 processes, 396 MB combined working set after 3 seconds, 0 TCP listening ports. This is a local single-run observation, not a performance guarantee. That development installer was approximately 102.5 MiB and unsigned.

First Beta preparation additionally verified `0.0.1-beta.1 → 0.0.1-beta.2` with actual NSIS installation and a local feed containing no Stable release. The installed default was Beta, `beta.yml` supplied the update, ordinary quit did not install, missing/failed Editor answers and unsaved work refused restart, and Save allowed installation/relaunch with document preservation and uninstall. Windows `ProductVersion` drops the prerelease identifier (`0.0.1.0` for both Betas); the regression now compares the complete `FileVersion` exactly, retaining `beta.1`/`beta.2`. Its first run exposed the old numeric-version assumption before that correction. This remains unsigned local-feed evidence, not signed GitHub delivery.

The same regression also passed for Stable `0.0.1 → 0.0.2`. Full workspace unit/integration and type checks passed, along with docs and whitespace checks. The final clean `0.0.1-beta.1` package passed artifact verification (`beta.yml` only, correct version/hash and GitHub provider without a test host) and all 7 packaged regressions, including initial Beta selection and saved Stable selection after restart. Direct execution showed the window in 681 ms, 4 processes, 395 MB combined working set after 3 seconds and no TCP listeners. The final approximately 102.5 MiB installer is unsigned and exists only in generated `apps/desktop/release/`; no remote CI, tag or public release was executed for Beta preparation.

The [first remote CI run](https://github.com/litzio/litzio/actions/runs/38190001483) passed the Windows installer/update/package job and both Editor browser shards. Its Linux quality job exposed a fixture error: the Windows `NsisUpdater` mock inherited the runner platform and requested `latest-linux.yml`/`beta-linux.yml`. The fixture now uses electron-updater's test platform option to model Windows on every runner; the actual provider, download/checksum/signature paths and assertions are unchanged. The initial unsigned Beta policy supersedes the original requirement that every public Beta be signed.

Before the unload fix, the first Saved DOM commit still prevented unload using the earlier Saving closure. The added browser regression failed on that state and passed when the guard read the current rendered busy ref. The real packaged Save→close→reopen path then completed normally. This changes no document, revision, selection/history or Save semantics. Electron test profiles retain Chromium state between runs; only app-owned test preferences/sample/logs are reset, and a failed close has a bounded cleanup that still fails the test.

Visual review used the same sample at 1440×1000 before/after the Desktop bridge, plus About at 1440×1000 and 375×812, DPR 1 / 100% zoom after fonts/images loaded. Captures are local `tmp/desktop-visual/`; only the Desktop footer was added to the sample view and About/actions fit the phone width. These are real Editor UI captures with a mock bridge, separately from packaged Windows execution.

`pnpm audit` reported 16 advisories (5 high, 10 moderate, 1 low), compared with 15 on the current baseline lockfile. The added advisory is optional build-time `sprintf-js@1.1.3` under electron-builder's download/proxy logger; it is not a runtime import or a shipped module in the bundled app. Existing Core/MyST and Editor tooling advisories remain; this work does not claim a clean security audit or change those dependencies. See the existing [MyST security follow-up](https://github.com/litzio/litzio/issues/11).

Signing credentials are not installed by this work. SmartScreen/reputation, corporate endpoint policy, OS IME/clipboard and physical touch require their respective real environments; automated mocked feeds and clipboard events do not establish those results. Signed real GitHub delivery and signing environment/secret setup remain future work. The first unsigned Beta was published from verified CI artifacts. Before it existed, GitHub update check errors were expected and did not block editing. These preceding paragraphs preserve preparation evidence; they do not describe the current public-release state.

## Settings update cue verification (#665)

This changes only Desktop notification preferences and Editor interactions; Core document semantics
and CLI operations are unaffected. Unit coverage checks bilingual accessible cues in both Sidebar
states, preference persistence and trusted/current-offer IPC acknowledgement. The mock-bridge browser
scenario checks acknowledgement, reload, a newer version, direct About navigation, highlight and
existing download/restart work protection. Packaged/install/update/uninstall execution is CI-only.

Local verification (2026-10-28): Editor 331 and Desktop 68 unit tests passed, workspace typecheck,
Editor production build, docs check, desktop-updates, layout-rules and quiet-document passed.
The browser used this checkout's persistent Chrome profile. BadPasswordAttempts checks were
0 before the first launch, then 1, 3, 4 and 5 after the final run; no further browser run was
started at 5. The dedicated 5365 Vite server and owned browser context were closed. Packaged
Desktop, installer/update/uninstall, Edge and fresh-profile probes were not run locally.

## Brand-independent release checks (#859 review)

The standard install/update (Stable and Beta), packaged Editor/CLI and uninstall regressions also run under the alternate brand configuration in a separate Windows `brand` job, parallel to Desktop. The [CI path policy](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#verification-matrix) selects it for identity, Desktop, dependency and CI policy changes and existing full-run fallbacks; ordinary Editor/Core/CLI/Docling source edits skip it. The job builds the official default package locally for the installer and plugin hashes, then runs the unchanged `scripts/check-brand-build.ts`. Only the small `brand-config` JSON/screenshot proof is uploaded for 7 days. The required aggregate keeps its existing check name and requires success when selected, permitting skips only when unselected. Their executable, installer, command, storage and channel names follow `brand.ts`; registry lookup uses the configured app ID and the pinned builder's NSIS GUID namespace. Existing foreign-file, PATH, unsaved-work and clean-account assertions remain in place.

The release verifier emits its validated installer, blockmap, current configured channel manifest and unpacked application as the workflow artifact paths, after executable/signature/blockmap verification. The publish job downloads that same layout and revalidates it. Custom channel names are retained without collecting unverified YAML files.
