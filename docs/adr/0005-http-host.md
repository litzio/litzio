# ADR-0005: Standalone HTTP Host

- Status: Accepted
- Last verified: 2026-10-31 (documentation-only ADR-0012 exception for plugin registration state and request records; no new runtime verification).
- Previous verification: 2026-10-13 (Node-only package, shared Host and real browser Save/Reload verification; Windows/Linux CI required).
- Authority: architectural decision under [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Related: [ADR-0002](0002-document-persistence-semantic-ownership.md), [ADR-0004](0004-desktop-host-distribution.md), [HTTP Host contract](../design/http-host-v1.md).
- Decision date: 2026-10-13

## Context

[#186](https://github.com/litzio/litzio/issues/186) requires a production Editor served from a workstation or Linux server, without Vite or Electron, and selection among separate operator-approved document folders. The existing local file handlers have no server-wide root allowlist. Desktop's custom protocol remains appropriate for the installed Windows app.

## Decision

- Add a thin CLI `daemon run` entry to a Node HTTP transport in `apps/editor/server` (official command `litzio daemon run` under [#1139](https://github.com/litzio/litzio/issues/1139); product names follow the [brand configuration](../guides/branding.md)). Reuse the document/asset handlers, Core semantics and File commit. Extract the existing production static-file helper for Desktop and HTTP. No new backend package or web framework.
- Require one or more existing `--root` directories at startup. Apply the fixed allowlist in the shared file operations, checking both normalized paths and real filesystem targets. HTTP cannot fall back to unrestricted access. Vite and Desktop explicitly select their existing local policy.
- A root grants file access; it is not the selected sidebar folder or a Workspace. Open Folder chooses one allowed root or descendant at a time; since [ADR-0009](0009-multiple-opened-folders.md) the sidebar may keep several such folders open, each still checked against the roots. HTTP starts without a document and exposes only allowed starting places and breadcrumbs.
- Bind to loopback by default. Enforce Host/Origin checks, bounded request bodies and timeouts. Remote access belongs behind operator-controlled authentication or a trusted private network; the application does not implement accounts or authentication. A configured public origin never comes from forwarded request headers.
- Ship a relocatable Node CLI bundle and production Editor in a local npm tarball. Runtime needs supported Node.js, without a source checkout, pnpm, tsx, Vite or Electron. CI artifacts are not a public registry release.

## Consequences

Three transports reuse the same stateless file handlers. HTTP file state is startup configuration and an asset-receipt signing key; documents remain plain-text files. [ADR-0011](0011-code-module-boundary.md#app-conversion-connections-797) adds the explicitly scoped Docling device setting and one transient module task (#797); this is not document persistence or a job backend. [ADR-0012](0012-plugin-runtime-and-ui-contributions.md) additionally permits only plugin registration state and request records in the common installation folder as an exception to this stateless Host scope. Core gains no HTTP, filesystem or editor-engine types. This adds a Host launch command, not a document semantic operation.

Root validation does not create an OS sandbox against a hostile filesystem administrator. File commit's existing check/use race boundary remains. Protect all proxy routes, including HTML, static assets, API and media, and restrict direct upstream access. Exact limits, deployment settings and supported platforms are in the [HTTP contract](../design/http-host-v1.md).

## Non-decisions

Accounts, multi-user collaboration, autosave, document databases, Git/PR/tag switching, dynamic root management, Docker images and NAS-specific installers are outside this decision. Desktop distribution and updates remain governed by ADR-0004.
