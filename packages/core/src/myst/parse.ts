/**
 * Parse boundary. The canonical-write guard compares this parse with the parse of
 * its own output, so anything decided here is invisible to it:
 * - text is the user's text: MyST's default typographic quote substitution
 *   (markdown-it `typographer` + `smartquotes`) would turn `Don't` into `Don’t`,
 *   so it is off, and a typed straight quote reloads exactly as written;
 * - a leading UTF-8 byte order mark is an encoding signature, not content;
 * - front matter is marked so canonical write preserves its metadata role;
 * - table directive kinds, options and parser diagnostics survive lifting for native admission;
 * - footnote definitions get their own source lines and follow the body in endnote order, as
 *   canonical write puts them; those the parse dropped are recorded.
